## Pre-requisites:

You need the following information about the song before proceeding:

- The [CCLI#](https://us.search.ccli.com/) of the song.  If there isn't a CCLI#, you'll follow a different process, which [hasn't been written yet](brokenlink.html)
- The length of the original recording in minutes and seconds.
- The starting key of the original recording, or the key of the original song if it was recorded in a different key than written.
- The ending key if the song changes keys in the middle.
- The tempo of the song in beats per minute (BPM).  [You can tap out the tempo here.](https://www.all8.com/tools/bpm.htm)
- The song's meter (4/4, 3/4, 6/4, 6/8, etc.)

{% include note.html content="A note on meter.  Ableton live locks tempo to quarter notes.  If a song is in 6/8 or 3/4, in Ableton, the tempo will need to be either 3/4 or 6/4 for correct click timing.  6/8 doesn't translate well to tempo settings in Ableton Live." %}

## Steps

1. Login to Planning Center
1. Switch to the Services application.
1. Click the Songs link from the top menu.
1. Click "add a song" at the top right of the song list.
1. If you know the CCLI # enter it.  If not, google the CCLI #.  Finding the right song is much easier if you have this number.
1. When you identify the correct song in the drop-down, choose it.
1. Select the Type of song depending upon the tags available.
1. Unless this is a variation of the original arrangement by the original artist, leave this field set as "Default Arrangement."
1. Complete the remaining information as needed.
1. If lyrics and chord charts are available, select the checkboxes in the SongSelect area.  If they are _not_ available, click Accept and then [continue to the section below](https://newvalleyresources.com/how-to-add-a-song-to-planning-center.html#unable-to-import-lyrics)
1. Click Accept

Now that you've created the song in Planning Center, you have access to the default arrangement as imported from Song Select.  Or, if ultimately unavailable online, you've [manually transcribed the arrangement](https://newvalleyresources.com/how-to-add-a-song-to-planning-center.html#steps-for-manual-transcription).

## Unable to Import Lyrics

That's okay. What you'll need is the ChordPro version of the chord charts for this song.  You can often find that at [worshiptogether.com](http://www.worshiptogether.com/)  Go there, find the song, then download the ChordPro version of the lyrics/chorc chart.

## Manual Transcription

There comes a time when a song hasn't been completely published and you still need the chord charts and lyrics.  That's okay too.  Manual transcription is a good skill to have.  

Work through the original recording and do your best to transcribe it as it's recorded in its original key.  Then, once you have a grasp on the arrangement, follow these steps to update the song that you've already added to Planning Center:
