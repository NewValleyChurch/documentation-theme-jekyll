## 9-17-2018

-	// Chauvet IRC450 Wash and 350Z Spots were flown on the FOH lighting pipe.  Power and DMX to be run tomorrow (9-18-2018).  The moving heads require a remote switching power source as they're "always on" if they're plugged into a power source.  The only solutions are to either kill the breaker to shut down the power when they're not in use, or wire up a switch to the circuit.  Another option is to wire up a wireless 4-channel relay power distribution block.  That is what will be happening which will ensure that the units are only on when they need to be on.
-	// Inventoried the Wash lights in the database.
-	// Tested the concept of having a black background on the rear projection wall from the bottom of the projection screen to the floor.  There are mixed emotions about it, so we'll put that idea on the back-burner for now.

## 9-15-2018

-	// Installed iLok License Manager on MediaOne to authorize various plugins for Ableton Live.
-	// Installed a few Ableton Live instrument plug-ins on MediaOne.
-	// Configured QLC+ chasers to contain wall wash for stage left and right side wings.

## 9-14-2018

-	// Elation OPTI RGBA lights that were previously flown over the apron of the stage have been moved to wash the walls of the storage wings.
-	// Ran 12/3 300V SJOOW power to all four lights.  One fixture has not yet been mounted and the remaining MEGA-LITE Cool White and Warm White fixtures have not been flown.
-	// Installed diffusers on each of the 4 lights to widen the beam angle.
-	// Ran DMX from the splitter to both sets of lights.

## 9-10-2018

-	// Mounted DMX 6-Way splitter near power source on beam in sanctuary, stage right.

## 8-21-2018

-	// Installed a program called Splice on MediaOne.  Splice is a collaboration tool for audio creatives that allows us to seamlessly keep the Ableton Sets synchronized between one or more computers running Ableton Live.  **Note, when using Splice to open an Ableton File, ensure that no other computer is already logged in to Splice.**

## 7-31-2018

-	// Enttec Playback Wing arrived today which will be our external console control for the lighting system.
-	// Enttec ArtNet Ethernet to DMX adapter arrived.  This will allow us to control the lighting through the network rather than through a direct USB connection.  The major advantage is that more than one device can stand in as the control on any given day.
-	// Installed Enttec Node Management Utility on MediaOne (NMU)
-	// Ordered 24-Port Ubuquity UNI POE Managed Network Switch and Patch Panel
-	// Installed Enttec ODE Mk2 Node for lighting and tested with QLC+

## 7-20-18

-	//  Identified issue with mouse cursor sticking periodically.  Problem has been isolated and worked around.
-	//	Installed EZ WIFI for the EIKI Projectors

## 7-19-18

-	//  Met with Clearwing to finalize order and estimate delivery of supplies and lights.
-	//  Lights should be shipped and ready to install by the end of the month.
-	//  Researched suppliers for rigging hardware and designed overhead rigging solution.
-	//  Repositioned house lights bank 1 lighting.  There are now 5 track lights spanning the inside of the 35' wide stage between the wings instead of having two lights throwing a beam directly on the wings.

## 7-18-18

-	//  Confirmed final configuration and parts list for lighting.
-	//  Order has been approved and placed with Clearwing for new lighting.

## 7-6-18

-	//  Met today with a lighting supply company at the sanctuary to help envision a more comprehensive lighting setup.  Plans to add lighting are progressing slowly.  The current goal is to have, at bare minimum, improved front lighting for the subjects on stage during the service and any other events.
