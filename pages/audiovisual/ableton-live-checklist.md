## Step by Step Guide

- Make sure that the QU-32 mixing console is on and connected to the iMac.
- Confirm that the iMac's `input` is set to QU-32.  To do this, on the keyboard, hold down the Option key, then click the speaker icon in the status bar at the top right-hand side of the screen.
- Confirm that the iMac's `output` is set to QU-32.  This allows playback through the the DSP from the iMac through Spotify/YouTube, etc.  Same process as step 2, but select in the Output section of the speaker icon menu.

**iMac System audio is now configured to use the QU-32 console as input _and_ output.**

- Open Ableton Live.  (Option-Space to open Alfred, then type 'Live').  Press enter when you see Ableton Live 10.  Alternatively, click the gray 'Live' icon on the dock at the bottom of the screen.
- Confirm Ableton Live Audio engine settings.
    - Go to Live --> Preferences in the top menu. (Command + Comma)
    - Click the `Audio` tab.
    - Ignore `Driver Type.`
    - Select `QU-32` in the `Audio Input` drop-down.

    {% include important.html content="The **Audio Output** selection is not required for Ableton Live to record input.  It is _only_ required if we need to monitor inputs on the fly, or play back what we've recorded." %}

    - Click the `Input Config` button in the Audio Device section of the Audio tab.
    - Select all of the `Mono` buttons for the channel(s) that need to be recorded so they are lit up.  This makes their input selection available to each Audio track in Ableton Live.
    - ... to be continued.
