## 7-31-2018

-	// Enttec Playback Wing arrived today which will be our external console control for the lighting system.
-	// Enttec ArtNet Ethernet to DMX adapter arrived.  This will allow us to control the lighting through the network rather than through a direct USB connection.  The major advantage is that more than one device can stand in as the control on any given day.
-	// Installed Enttec Node Management Utility on MediaOne (NMU)
-	// Ordered 24-Port Ubuquity UNI POE Managed Network Switch and Patch Panel
-	// Installed Enttec ODE Mk2 Node for lighting and tested with QLC+

## 7-20-18

-	//  Identified issue with mouse cursor sticking periodically.  Problem has been isolated and worked around.
-	//	Installed EZ WIFI for the EIKI Projectors

## 7-19-18

-	//  Met with Clearwing to finalize order and estimate delivery of supplies and lights.
-	//  Lights should be shipped and ready to install by the end of the month.
-	//  Researched suppliers for rigging hardware and designed overhead rigging solution.
-	//  Repositioned house lights bank 1 lighting.  There are now 5 track lights spanning the inside of the 35' wide stage between the wings instead of having two lights throwing a beam directly on the wings.

## 7-18-18

-	//  Confirmed final configuration and parts list for lighting.
-	//  Order has been approved and placed with Clearwing for new lighting.

## 7-6-18

-	//  Met today with a lighting supply company at the sanctuary to help envision a more comprehensive lighting setup.  Plans to add lighting are progressing slowly.  The current goal is to have, at bare minimum, improved front lighting for the subjects on stage during the service and any other events.
