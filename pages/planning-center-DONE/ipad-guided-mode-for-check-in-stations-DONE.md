Guided mode is a setting on an iPad that allows you to open a single app and lock it, allowing or disallowing custom input controls while Guided mode is enabled..

Currently, both iPad Check In stations in the Kids area have been enabled with Guided mode.

## How to Turn Guided Mode On or Off
While Guided mode is enabled, any time you triple click the main iPad button, the iPad will respond with prompts from Guided mode.

### To Launch Guided Mode

- Open the app you want to be locked open.
- Triple tap the main iPad button.
- Select your input options from the guided mode settings, then start guided mode.
- The app will lock open and you won't have access to anything else.

### To End Guided Mode

- Triple click the iPad home button.
- Enter the Guided mode security code.
- The iPad will now be _out_ of guided mode and you can configure the iPad or open a different app for guided mode.


This is a great solution for a kiosk that needs to be secured.  Securing with an iPad screen lock can be problematic because invalid attempts to open a locked iPad will lock everyone out for up to 60 minutes (including the administrator.)
