Welcome to the New Valley Church Staff & Volunteer resources website, where you can find just about anything you need to know about anything at New Valley Church.  If it isn't here, or it's not yet complete, let us know about it and we'll get right on it!

# Purpose of This Site

The ultimate purpose of this site is to communicate what needs to be known to those who need to know it when they need to know it.

To build a comprehensive resource containing all of the pertinent information we need on a daily and weekly basis to help the staff and volunteers complete the tasks they need to complete efficiently.
