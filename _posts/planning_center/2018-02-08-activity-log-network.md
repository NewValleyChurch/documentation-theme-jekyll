According to Mailchimp, in a press release today, they are replacing static segments in our accounts with tags.  [Here is more information](https://mailchimp.com/help/getting-started-tags/) about tags.

Planning Center is integrated with Mailchimp through lists which are synchronized at Mailchimp as Static Segments.  The developers at Planning Center are aware of the issue and will be working to provide an update to their user base if anything should interrupt the normal flow.
