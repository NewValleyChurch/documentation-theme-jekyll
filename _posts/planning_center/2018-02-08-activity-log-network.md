According to Mailchimp, in a press release today, they are replacing static segments in our accounts with tags.  [Here is more information](https://mailchimp.com/help/getting-started-tags/) about tags.

Planning Center is integrated with Mailchimp through lists which are synchronized at Mailchimp as Static Segments.  <!--more-->  The developers at Planning Center are aware of the issue and will be working to provide an update to their user base if anything should interrupt the normal flow.
