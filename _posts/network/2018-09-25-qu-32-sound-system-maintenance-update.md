Over the past few weeks we have been experiencing a problem with the in-ear monitoring systems.

## Problem

When loading a pre-saved scene, keys on the ME-1 that have been grouped seem to lose some of their grouped input channels.  The specific example is the Drum group.  When a scene is changed, two of the 6 grouped channels consistenly drop from the group and have to be manually re-assigned on some ME-1 units, but not on others.

## Potential Remedy

Bring all hardware firmware up to current specs.  All of the ME-1's are current.  The ME-U, and the QU-32 will be updated to the latest firmware.  

{% include important.html content="There is a service announcement on the pages of the QU-32 at Allen & Heath indicating that the new update to OSX Mojave is an unsuported OS presently.  How this would affect us is unknown at this point as the only connection that we make between the QU-32 and the MediaOne workstation is for USB streaming.  So, if the USB Streaming (i.e. audio recording [sermon] and playback [spotify/youtube]) is affected, then we will need to wait to upgrade MediaOne to Mojave." %}

{% include note.html content="Mojave, however, does solve the DisplayLink issue with externally connected USB to HDMI video adapters that High Sierra disabled.  Our current system is only running on Sierra because of this issue.  If we update to High Sierra, we lose our stage display for ProPresenter.  When Mojave is released, we will be assured that the video function will be restored, but must consider the implications with the QU-32 desk." %}

## QU-32 Firmware Update

Our current version is 1.93 R4555.  The update will bring us up to 1.95 R4561.


Performing the update didn't change the problem.  At this point, I have a call into Allen & Heath for more information about what could be causing the problem.  Until then, we'll have to work through it.
