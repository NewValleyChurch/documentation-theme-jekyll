As a result of a few people mentioning that it seems like the piano is tucked really far away from the rest of the band, I shifted the keyboard station closer to the drums.  In doing so, I tucked away one of the music stands in storage and disconnected the ME-1 on that stand.  The white ethernet cable for this station is to the right (stage-right) of the dSnake along with both of the channel inputs for that station.  I figured it would look nicer if we don't have someone filling that spot on a given Sunday to wrap it up and make it less cluttered.  

The last time we had this station connected it was for Kenny's instruments.

## Keyboard Changes
Over the past few weeks I've been slowly transitioning from the Akai Advance 61 Keyboard to the Yamaha CP33.  As of yesterday, I was able to completely remove the Akai from the rig along with the headaches that accompanied it.  It's just not live-play-friendly.  I've shifted from using VIP3.0 as the VST Plug-in manager for keyboard sounds to MainStage.  While MainStage will provide the layers of sounds, Ableton Live is still our primary engine for our clock and backing tracks.
