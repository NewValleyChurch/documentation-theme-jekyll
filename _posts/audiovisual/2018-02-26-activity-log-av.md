- Changed the **Useful Stuff** section of the e-mail to include the correct A/V Home Page link and added the Waffle.io "Open Issues / Problems" link to get to the project board for the New Valley GitHub Issues tracker.
- Connected the audio/visual news feed to Slack via the applications integrations.  New articles will be posted to the GitHub channel on Slack as well as being e-mailed out the following morning.
