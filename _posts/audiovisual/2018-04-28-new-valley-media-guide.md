The current New Valley Media guide has been added to the [media home page.](/media.html).

The information contained in this guide is quickly becoming outdated.  What you see on this page is simply a copy of what we currently have on file, arranged in an expanding accordion section format.  For the most part, the processes are as they were, with pending changes coming to accommodate our shifting technology needs.

Currently there are no images posted to the page to mirror the document we have printed out right now, but that will slowly change.

It would be helpful, on that page, to use the commenting section to make suggestions or report issues with that page.

At the bottom of any page on the resource website is a Disqus commenting form.  Get yourself setup with a Disqus account and utilize this feature for support and questions.
