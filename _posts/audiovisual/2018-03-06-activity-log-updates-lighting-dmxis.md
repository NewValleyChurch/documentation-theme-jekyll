- Updated the iMac to Java 8 Update 161 in order to install the OSC Layout Editor
- Enabled OSC input/output on the DMXIS.
- Installed safety cables on DMX Lighting.
- Adjusted lighting position on RGBA lamps (FOH) and two of the Unicolor Lamps.

All RGBA lamsp were positioned to throw evenly at the apron of the stage across from stage left to right.  These particular lamps cannot be focused or modified beyond a simple X/Y axis and they aren't automated, so there's no way to reposition them without manually climbing up and doing so.  The two unicolor lamps above the stage were pointed directly downward.  

- Created additional scenes in DMXIS under bank 003 and configured the system for remote access via MIDI, which allows selection of banks and scenes from an external source.
- DMXIS allows remote access via TouchOSC which is an iOS app for mobile devices.  Exploring that option to provide remote control from iOS devices when connected to the local network.
