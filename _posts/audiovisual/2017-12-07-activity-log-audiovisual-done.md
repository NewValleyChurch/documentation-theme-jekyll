- Wiring up the house lights to the [DMXIS](/DMXIS.html).  We still need a female connector for the connection at the DS8 light dimmer control.  [DMXIS](/DMXIS.html) was moved to the right side of the QU32.  D-SPLIT installed with power.  Connector on sound booth side soldered and connected to D-SPLIT.  Connector on DS8 side soldered but it's the wrong connector.

- Adjusted the angle of some of the FOH lights.

- Created a wiring diagram overview of the lighting system based upon current setup.
